# Vr-Detective-Cinematic
It's a small VR experience where you have to find who committed the crime, this is my final project for university.
Hope you like it!

## Controls:
In-game buttons can be physically pressed using the hands, the lower rear trigger buttons are for picking up objects that are too far away.

## Recommendations:
- Use in an open space due to the danger of colliding with real life objects.
- In the event that the app starts from a position that is not correct, it is recommended to reset the view from the menu of the virtual reality glasses themselves, once the view is restarted it will be in the appropriate initial position. If this does not work, it is recommended to exit and enter the application.

## Important:
In the case of using the PC exe for the Oculus Quest 2, you need to have Steam VR and the Oculus application downloaded and open.
